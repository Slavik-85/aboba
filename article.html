  <h1>Community Unites for Annual Food and Clothing Drive</h1>
  <h2>Sofia Residents Gather to Support Those in Need</h2>

  <p>
    Sofia, Bulgaria – This weekend, the vibrant neighborhoods of Sofia will come together for the much-anticipated <strong>Annual Food and Clothing Drive</strong>, organized by the local charity “Hearts of Sofia.” Volunteers and donors alike are encouraged to drop off non-perishable food items, gently used clothing, and winter essentials at designated collection points throughout the city.
  </p>

  <p>
    The event will take place from <em>June 5th to June 7th</em> at three community centers: Lozenets Cultural Hall, Vitosha Park Pavilion, and the Student Campus in Studentski Grad. Each location will operate from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily. In addition to the drop-off stations, there will be informational booths, live music performances, and complimentary refreshments for participants.

    “We believe that no one in our community should struggle without basic necessities,” said Maria Dimitrova, Executive Director of Hearts of Sofia. <q>Every contribution, no matter how small, can make a real difference in someone’s life.</q> She emphasized that last year’s drive collected over 5,000 kilograms of donations and helped more than 1,200 families during the winter months. This year, the goal is to surpass those numbers and expand outreach to rural areas surrounding Sofia.

    “The generosity we witnessed last year was truly heartwarming,” expressed Volunteer Coordinator Ivan Petrov. “From blankets to canned goods, the community’s response was overwhelming. We anticipate an even bigger turnout this year, and we’re especially excited to have local schools and businesses participating as official drop-off points.”

    In addition to collecting essentials, the organizers have arranged for mobile vans to visit several neighborhoods on the outskirts of Sofia. These vans will accept donations directly from residents who may find it difficult to travel to the main collection centers. The schedule for these mobile vans will be posted on the official Hearts of Sofia website and social media channels.
